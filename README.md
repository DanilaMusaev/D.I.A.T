D.I.A.T - Die In The Apex Tool service, which I am developing/have developed.

This is a service that provides an opportunity to randomly select a legend for yourself / your team for the next round, save the number of packs opened, as well as the history of your game in rating mode and display its statistics and dynamics.
This service is absolutely useless, because there are already many others that provide much more functionality, but who cares at all? As a developer, I don't give a damn if anyone will use it. P.S. It's currently under development.

Enjoy if you want
